Doc1 is a Dataset with column (a CSVColumn header "Alt" variable Altitude)
with column (a CSVColumn header "u0" variable AirSpeed)
with column (a CSVColumn header "tt" variable TotalTemperature)
with location "file://aske/files/doc1.csv".

//Doc2 is the int List [2,3,4].
//Doc3 is a table [double alt (alias "Alt") (Altitude {"ft"}), double u0 (AirSpeed {"mph"}), double tt (TotalTemperature {"R"})] with data located at "http://somewhere".
